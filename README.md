## Assembly Instructions

To do...

## Software

- The case was modeled using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)
- My NixOS configuration for the Raspberry Pi itself can be found in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/pgattic/dotfiles/tree/main/hosts/cyberpi), but Raspberry Pi OS works perfectly fine.
